## About Minecraft

Minecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Markus Persson, also known online as 'Notch', and Mojang AB. Players explore a randomly-generated infinite world made up of cube-shaped blocks forming a landscape filled with lakes, mountains, forests, caves and deserts. To survive the resources of the world must be exploited to cook food, craft weapons and armour, build shelters and kill monsters.

## About Mojang

Mojang actually started life before Minecraft when Markus Persson (Notch) and a friend called Rolf Jansson developed a massively-multiplayer online role-playing game called Wurm Online. Mojang Specifications AB was set up when they decided to charge for premium accounts. After Notch left Wurm Online, he retained the name Mojang and Jansson changed the name of the company behind Wurm to Code Club AB.

After the unprecedented success of Minecraft, Notch set up Mojang AB to assist in sales and development of Minecraft, as well as other projects. He now employs several other people to assist in the business aspects as well as support and development of Minecraft itself.

Mojang are developing a second game - a strategy collectible card game named Scrolls. They are also publishing Cobalt, a side-scrolling action game developed by Oxeye Game Studio.
